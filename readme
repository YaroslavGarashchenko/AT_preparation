The system of technological preparation of additive manufacturing

The developed system includes research tools using applied statistics and methodology allows to solve the following tasks:
- —Åonvert (import) STL-files of 3D-models of industrial products in the database of geometric characteristics (coordinates of vertices and normal vectors) of triangular faces;
- perform a layer analysis of the 3D model of the product to assess the geometric complexity and the possibility of layer-by-layer manufacturing;
- create a voxel 3D-model of the product to perform the analysis of the distribution of elementary volumes in the layer-by-layer working space for evaluating options for applying structural decomposition;
- perform colour visualization of 3D model of the product for the tasks of verifying the triangulation model correctness, analyzing the process design and making decisions at the stage of technological preparation;
- based on a multicriteria evaluation, determine the rational range of rotation angles of the 3D model of the product for its rational orientation;
- to make a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of various options for placing 3D models of products in the workspace;
- export data (triangle database data) of the prepared 3D model to the formats: STL (for materialization using traditional technologies or Additive Manufacturing), AMF / PLY (for multicolour model visualization) and XLS (for data analysis in third-party application);
- to determine the statistical characteristics of the distribution of the features being studied, characterizing the properties of the triangulated 3D model and the technological processes of additive technologies;
- visualization and recording of initial data and research results.

The subsystem for the colour rendering of the triangulation model is the most interesting. It is destined to test its design for solving problems of technological preparation. This system allows you to evaluate the quality of triangulation of the 3D model, the technological design of the product and perform an analysis of the effectiveness of additive technologies. When developing the colour visualization sub-system following main tasks were solved:
- an estimation of correctness and rationality of triangulation of CAD-model;
- working out of a design for product manufacturability at the use of additive technologies;
- visual assessment of the possibility of determining the rational orientation of the product in the working area of the construction. The developed subsystem presents the user with the following basic options for setting parameters and operating modes with subsequent visualization of the results:
- selection of test indication of 16 characteristics proposed for the analysis of product model;
- automatic formation of the colour scale when specifying the number of intervals and colour for the first and last interval;
- editing intervals or selectively deleting them in the colour scale database to match the values of the feature being examined;
- colour editing for each value interval using the colour selection dialogue box;
- saving the colour model to PLY, AMF and for additional analysis as a data table in XLS format (or in TXT format in the absence of MS Excel application);
- statistical analysis and plotting of distribution histogram of the characteristics;
- recording of settlement data in a common table for comparative analysis;
- determination of basic statistical characteristics (12 parameters);
- saving the results of statistical analysis to XLS-format file for further analysis using third-party software;
- output form of visualization of analysis results in the form of density or integral probability function.
